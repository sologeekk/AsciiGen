# AsciiGen
Quite Handy and Sassy Python3 application to Generate Fancy Ascii Art Text Banners that comes with some other cool Features as well, Such as Updating fonts, Choosing a font of your interest for the next run, Showing current font or Copying your art to clipboard so you won't miss it :)

# Why?
No seriously, I just got bored :<

# How to Install
* I'm using `Python 3.10.0` at the time of writing this for my developing purposes.
* Clone the project:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sologeekk/AsciiGen.git
$ cd AsciiGen
```
* You have to make sure all the requirements are met. so after Downloading/Clonning the project, Type this in a **Virtual Environment** *(Higly Recommended)* Terminal Session:
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* And finally you're good to GO :)

# Some Samples
```bash
$ python3 ./asciiFun.py 
$ [♦] Enter a string: AsciiGen
