# AsciiGen
Quite Handy and Sassy Python3 application to Generate Fancy Ascii Art Text Banners that comes with some other cool Features as well, such as Updating fonts, Choosing a font on your interest, showing current fonts or Copying your art so you wont miss it :)

# Why?
No seriously, I just got bored :<

# How to Install
* I'm using `Python 3.10.0` at the time of writing this for my developing purposes.
* First you have to make sure all the requirements are met. so after Downloading/Clonning the project, Type this in a **Virtual Environment** *(Higly Recommended)* Terminal Session:
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* And finally you're good to GO :)

*Im always open to your feedbacks, so feel free to contact me or contribute in my projects.
*Also big shoutout to my Boi @pwaller for his awesome project.
